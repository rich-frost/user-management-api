# User Management API

Demo API, managing users in a MongoDB.

## Installation

To get setup, clone this repo and run `npm install`

This will download all the necessary dependencies.


## Prerequisites before running

It is expected you have a running local MongoDB, read here if you haven't already installed MongoDB [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/]

The API expects there to be a MongoDB created called UsersDB locally, i.e.: `mongodb://localhost:27017/UsersDB`.
Please make sure you have created this before running the API.

Future enhancement will allow you to pass in the DB name...

## Running the API

To get the API up and running, from the commandline run `npm start`

The API will be running on [http://localhost:4000]

## Documentation

Live documentation is provided in Swagger at [http://localhost:4000/documentation]
